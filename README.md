# PokÃ©mon Android Application

This is a PokÃ©mon Android application built using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Hilt for dependency injection, and the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern. The application fetches a list of PokÃ©mon from a server, and upon clicking an item, navigates to a details page to show more information about the selected PokÃ©mon.

## Features

- Fetch PokÃ©mon list from the server.
- Display PokÃ©mon list using Jetpack Compose.
- Navigate to a details page on item click.
- Show detailed information of the selected PokÃ©mon.

## Architecture

The application follows the MVVM architecture pattern:

- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic of the app. In this app, it includes data classes and repository classes for fetching PokÃ©mon data from the server.
- **View:** Composes UI elements using Jetpack Compose.
- **ViewModel:** Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View. It holds and manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.

## Dependencies

- **Kotlin**: A modern programming language that makes developers happier.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI.
- **Hilt**: A dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection.
- **Retrofit**: A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- **Coroutines**: For managing background threads and simplifying code to run asynchronously.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Bumblebee (or later)
- Gradle 7.0 (or later)
- Internet connection (to fetch PokÃ©mon data)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pokemon-app.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Sync the project with Gradle files.

### Configuration

The project uses Retrofit to fetch data from the server. Make sure you have the correct base URL in your `ApiService` class.

## Usage

1. Launch the app on an Android device or emulator.
2. The main screen will display a list of PokÃ©mon fetched from the server.
3. Click on any PokÃ©mon item to navigate to the details page and view more information.
